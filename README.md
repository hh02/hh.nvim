# hh.nvim

base on NvChad, use coc.nvim instead.

Used as notepad, focus on start speed.

## TODO

- [ ] adapt coc.nvim statusline to nvchad-ui
- [ ] better organize (plugins, mappings, just like lazyvim)
- [ ] plugins from lazyvim
- [ ] reduce coc.nvim suggest number
- [ ] better coc.nvim lazy load (now is after insertEnter)
